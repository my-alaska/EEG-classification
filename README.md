# EEG-classification

This repository contains code created as a part of a project for Computer Science in Medicine course at AGH University of Krak√≥w in 2024.

The task of the project was to create a neural network that would predict a probability distribution of harmful brain activities from EEG signal.

To run this code you need to have a machine with Python and jupyter installed. You can install jupyter by pip.

`pip install jupyter`

You need to create a `data` directory next to the the eeg_model_training.ipynb file, download the data from [this kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification) and place it there.

After that you can start a jupyter session.

`jupyter notebook`

You'll be able to navigate to the eeg_model_training.ipynb and run the code.
